I am a postdoc candidate at the Observatory of Nice. 
<!-- My research is devoted to numerical and theoretical studies of classical and quantum turbulent flows. 
My expertise includes the performance of high-resolution direct numerical simulations using parallel computing methods, 
and the application of statistical methods for the analysis of turbulent flows.  -->
My scientific work is focused on theoretical and numerical studies of superfluid turbulence, mainly based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. 
I am interested in the properties of two- and three-dimensional turbulence, intermittency in quantum and classical flows, and the interaction between quantum vortices and coherent structures in superfluids.
